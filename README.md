# assignment-1-final

For this project, I added a background to the website and included a border in the middle with the content on it. The page shows a welcome message and displays the current location, its date and time(including milliseconds). Below it is a different address with their respective date and time. I included a refresh button to refresh the date and time for both locations when clicked and there's a counter to keep track of how many times it was clicked.
